# go-playground
My sandbox for Go web service to transition from Node.js into Golang entirely.

# TODO
* Seek alternatives for Go's `Martini`.
* Seek `rails` like `asset pipeline` or `django compressor` for Go.


# Deadlines
* Finish `AMF0` and `AMF3` lib off by end of Feb 20, 2015. Base source off `SabreAMF` and my Java `AMF3` lib.
